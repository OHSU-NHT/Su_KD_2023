**How to use the snRNA data analysis scripts**
1. Pre-process the aligned data and aggregate three control samples or all six samples (three control and three experimental. <br/>
Pre-process_Step1.R <br/>
Pre-process_Step2.R <br/>

3. Analyze the aggreaged and annotated dataset <br/>
Analysis_1_AddModuleScore.R <br/>
Analysis_2__Find_DEGs.R <br/>
Analysis_3_Pathway_analysis.R <br/>

4. Make figures for the manuscript. <br/>
